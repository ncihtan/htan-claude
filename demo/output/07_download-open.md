# Find the smallest open-access scRNA-seq file from breast cancer and download it using synapse get

---

Done! Here's a summary:

**Smallest open-access scRNA-seq breast cancer file:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| HTAN Data File ID | `HTA6_2502_80` |
| Filename | `HTA6_2502_4-barcodes.tsv.gz` |
| Atlas | HTAN Duke |
| Level | Level 3 |
| Format | tsv (gzipped) |
| Size | 2,871 bytes (~2.9 KB) |
| Synapse ID | `syn64372046` |

The file was downloaded to `./data/HTA6_2502_4-barcodes.tsv.gz`. Note this is a barcodes file (cell barcode list) from a Level 3 scRNA-seq dataset — the smallest component of the count matrix triplet (barcodes, features, matrix). If you need the full count matrix or a larger h5ad file, let me know.
